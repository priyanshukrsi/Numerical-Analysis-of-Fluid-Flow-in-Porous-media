# Numerical-Analysis-of-Fluid-Flow-in-Porous-media
I have done the numerical modelling of pressure equation for fluid flow in porous media.


The numerical modelling has been with the following 2 methods :

     1) Finite Difference Method
           -> FTCS Scheme
           -> BTCS Scheme
           -> Crank-Nicolson Method
           
     2) Finite Volume Method
